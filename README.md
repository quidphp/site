### Convention
**QuidPHP/Site** is built on the following conventions:
- *Traits*: Traits filenames start with an underscore (_).
- *Coding*: No curly braces are used in a IF statement if the condition can be resolved in only one statement.
- *Type*: Files, function arguments and return types are strict typed.
- *Config*: A special $config static property exists in all classes. This property gets recursively merged with the parents' property on initialization.
- *Auto-alias*: All class names that finishes by Alias will resolve to the existing class if no alias exists. Exemple: MyRole extents RoleAlias -> will resolve to Role if no alias is found.
- *Core overloading*: This namespace overloads many classes from Quid\Core and Quid\Lemur.
